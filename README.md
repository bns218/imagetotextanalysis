Objective:
To assess your ability to work with AI/ML models, creatively use APIs, and build a novel solution. This task will evaluate your coding skills, understanding of AI/ML concepts, and problem-solving abilities.

Task Overview:
You are required to build a Python application that generates AI-powered artwork descriptions and categorizes them based on emotional tone.

Task Description:
You will create an application that takes an image URL as input, generates a descriptive text (artwork description) using a pre-trained image-to-text model, and then analyzes the generated description to categorize it by emotional tone (e.g., happy, sad, neutral).

Use APIs:
For Image-to-Text Generation, use a pre-trained model from Hugging Face or Replicate.com that specializes in generating detailed descriptions from images.

For Emotion Analysis, use a sentiment analysis or emotion detection model available via the Hugging Face API to classify the tone of the generated description.

Build a Python Script:
The script should:
1. Accept an image URL as input.
2. Use the selected model to generate a description of the image.
3. Analyze the emotional tone of the generated description.
4. Output the image description and the identified emotional tone.

Deliverables:
1. Python Script: A well-documented Python script that performs the complete task.
2. Example Outputs: Provide three examples of the scriptâ€™s output using different images.
3. URL to test the application you've developed
4. Github repository of this assignmet

Evaluation Criteria:
1. Code Quality: Clean, well-structured, and commented code.
2. Innovation: Creativity in combining multiple models to produce a unique solution.
3. Correctness: The script must correctly generate descriptions and classify emotions.
4. Documentation: Clear and comprehensive ReadMe instructions.
5. User Experience: Quality of the web interface.
